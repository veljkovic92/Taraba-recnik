# Taraba-recnik
(Hashtag-dictionary)

1. Introduction

The project is being purposely built for the company "Taraba Tech" and the theme is vocabulary of foreign words commonly used in serbian language. It defnitely is a good opportunity for me to practice vanilla JS (with some help of jQuery).
At the finished stage, it should allow the user to browse the words already present in the vocabulary, search for them by a word, first initial or looking at the whole database sorted by first initials. Every word can be individually selected and the details, such as home and foreign meaning, similar words and type will be shown.
Since one of the project's prerequisites was not to use React.js, I've decided to keep it simple and only use jQuery from available "JS shortcuts". With it, I purposely avoided SASS and wrote plain CSS here for the sake of doing it old-school.
